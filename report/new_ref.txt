Abstract: This paper investigates the efficiency of university–industry collaboration (UIC) within the UK higher education system, focusing specifically on contract research activities as a key channel of formalized interaction between universities and firms. The authors begin by reviewing the literature on UIC, highlighting different forms of collaboration such as informal and formal personal relationships, third-party interactions, formal targeted agreements, non-targeted agreements, and focused structures. While much of the existing literature concentrates on patents and licensing, the paper argues that contract research, which is motivated more by research-related advantages than by purely commercial goals, deserves greater attention due to its significant contribution to knowledge creation and research activity. To explore the efficiency of contract research, the study employs a data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach combined with regression methods, drawing on a comprehensive dataset covering UK higher education institutions (HEIs). The dataset includes financial and operational variables, such as income from research contracts with industry and public sources, as well as data on institutional characteristics. The methodology allows the authors to assess relative efficiency levels, identify performance gaps, and determine the factors that drive effective collaborations. The results show substantial variation in efficiency across universities. A key finding is that universities in the UK exhibit significant inefficiencies in contract research, with a considerable number failing to convert inputs into outputs at the same level as top performers. Larger and research-intensive universities tend to achieve higher efficiency, but this is not a universal rule, suggesting that factors beyond size, such as management practices, governance, and strategic orientation toward engagement with industry, are crucial. Moreover, the analysis highlights the distinction between contract research and intellectual property commercialization, noting that while the latter has often received more scholarly and policy attention, it generates relatively modest value compared to collaborative research. The study suggests that policymakers should not overemphasize patenting and licensing at the expense of other, potentially more impactful, channels of collaboration. In terms of determinants, the paper finds that resources dedicated to research, the quality of academic staff, and the presence of organizational support structures are strongly associated with higher efficiency. At the same time, regional factors play a significant role: universities located in regions with a stronger industrial base and innovation ecosystem tend to perform better, underlining the importance of geographical context in shaping collaborative outcomes. The authors conclude that while UK HEIs contribute meaningfully to industry collaboration, there remains untapped potential. Enhancing efficiency will require not only increasing resources but also aligning institutional strategies with industry needs, fostering relational mechanisms, and ensuring policy frameworks recognize the diversity of UIC forms. Overall, the paper advances the understanding of how efficiency in university–industry collaboration can be measured and improved, offering insights for both researchers and policymakers seeking to strengthen knowledge transfer and innovation ecosystems.

Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive review of research trends and practices in open innovation (OI) between universities and industries, focusing on research profiling, the forms and processes of open innovation, key influencing variables, and directions for future studies. The study begins by situating OI within the broader innovation management literature, noting Chesbrough’s introduction of the concept in 2003 and its subsequent expansion into a heterogeneous body of knowledge. While much prior work has centered on firm-level innovation and commercialization activities such as patents and licensing, this paper highlights the relative scarcity of systematic investigation into university-centered OI and argues for its importance in the innovation ecosystem.

Methodologically, the authors adopt a rigorous combination of bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review (SLR). The initial dataset was collected from Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus, yielding 2,759 papers. Following a multi-stage screening process—limiting the scope to English-language peer-reviewed journal articles, excluding conference papers, books, theses, and predatory journals—the dataset was reduced to 71 highly relevant studies. The review follows established SLR protocols, including the four-step process proposed by Kaur et al. (2020): planning the review with clear conceptual boundaries and keywords, specifying inclusion and exclusion criteria, extracting data through layered screening, and executing content analysis. Tools such as R Studio and Bibliometrix were used to ensure quality control, remove redundancy, and support bibliometric mapping. This dual approach—quantitative bibliometric profiling and qualitative content analysis—enabled the authors to capture both structural research trends and deeper thematic insights【21†source】.

The analysis of research themes shows an evolution over time. Between 2003 and 2010, the focus was primarily on open innovation, technology transfer, and university–industry collaboration. From 2011 to 2017, the literature expanded toward interdisciplinary cooperation and knowledge exchange. Since 2018, attention has increasingly shifted to the university’s role in innovation ecosystems, exploring governance mechanisms, stakeholder dynamics, and educational impacts【21†source】.

The paper describes university–industry open innovation as a process that encompasses inbound, outbound, and coupled flows of knowledge. Collaboration typically progresses through four phases: embryonic, initiation, engagement, and establishment. Critical enablers in this progression include trust building, explicit collaboration norms, management capability, and resource commitment. The AMO (Antecedent–Mediator/Moderator–Outcome) framework structures the review of influencing variables. Antecedents include alliance characteristics (size, culture, resources, geographic proximity), managerial capabilities (R&D strength, absorptive capacity, innovation climate), and collaboration motives (trust, funding, perceived gain). Mediators such as cohesiveness, IT capability, and professional competencies explain how collaborations translate into outcomes, while moderators such as firm age, leadership style, and prior collaboration experience condition their effectiveness【21†source】.

The outcomes of open innovation are varied, with benefits including enhanced innovation performance, knowledge transfer, research productivity, and technology commercialization. However, barriers such as information leakage, intellectual property disputes, insufficient support structures, and cultural or relational challenges persist. Enablers identified include entrepreneurial orientation, innovation intermediaries, effective IP strategies, and shared governance. The study underscores that OI partnerships are complex, involving both individual- and organizational-level drivers and constraints.

Finally, the authors propose a conceptual model integrating OI phases and educational impact, mapping how partnerships evolve and yield different levels of benefit. They highlight research gaps such as the need for more quantitative and longitudinal approaches, expanded study in under-researched regions (e.g., ASEAN), and greater theoretical integration. The paper concludes that universities play a crucial role in shaping open innovation ecosystems and calls for future research that bridges micro-level individual drivers with macro-level institutional and regional contexts.

Here’s a ~500-word plain-text summary of the paper by Rossi & Rosli (2015), Indicators of university–industry knowledge transfer performance and their implications for universities: evidence from the United Kingdom ￼.

This paper addresses the problem of how to measure the performance of universities in knowledge transfer (KT) activities, particularly in their interactions with industry. It argues that despite the importance of KT for universities’ “third mission,” there has been little theoretical work on appropriate performance indicators, with most existing measures evolving empirically in response to available data rather than conceptual rigor. The authors emphasize that KT is complex, involving multiple activities and impacts that go beyond patents and licensing, and that overly narrow indicators risk misrepresenting universities’ actual engagement while creating undesirable behavioral incentives. To ground this discussion, the paper uses the UK Higher Education Business and Community Interaction (HE-BCI) survey as a case study. The HE-BCI survey collects systematic quantitative data from all UK universities on a wide range of KT activities, which also serves as the basis for allocating public “third stream” funding such as the Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF). The survey covers activities such as contract and collaborative research, consultancy, CPD and CE courses, facilities and equipment services, regeneration programs, intellectual property (IP) activity, spin-offs, and social and cultural engagement. However, the authors argue that the survey still privileges certain activities, especially IP-related ones, over others. Four of ten sub-areas focus on patents, licensing, and spin-offs, despite evidence that few universities succeed significantly in this domain and that many disciplines—particularly arts and humanities—engage in KT through non-proprietary outputs. In contrast, less attention is paid to activities like open dissemination, community partnerships, or student placements, even though these can generate significant social and economic impacts. Furthermore, the survey’s focus on income as a key performance measure is problematic. Income is assumed to reflect impact, but this is questionable: it may instead reflect reputation, costs of delivery, or the economic profile of beneficiaries. For example, activities in medicine and engineering tend to generate high-cost, high-income outputs, while those in arts and humanities often produce lower-cost, lower-income outputs with potentially high social value. Similarly, universities may choose to transfer knowledge through free dissemination or open licenses, generating impacts that income measures cannot capture. The empirical analysis demonstrates that UK universities differ significantly in their KT objectives and profiles, which cluster into groups such as “Research and Technology Transfer,” “Education,” “General,” and “Local.” These profiles influence not only the types of activities undertaken but also the ability to accrue income. For instance, universities with a strong local or education focus often engage in more consultancy and community services per academic staff but generate less income compared to research-intensive institutions, resulting in lower HEIF funding despite active KT engagement. Regression analysis confirms that funding allocations correlate strongly with institutional size, disciplinary mix, and sectoral focus. Larger universities and those engaging with manufacturing sectors capture more income and thus receive more funding, while smaller institutions, those focused on arts and humanities, or those serving disadvantaged communities are disadvantaged. The paper concludes that relying on narrow, income-focused indicators risks rewarding scale and profitability rather than true performance or impact. It advocates for more comprehensive and flexible sets of indicators that capture the diversity of KT activities and impacts, including qualitative aspects such as interaction quality, stakeholder satisfaction, and long-term benefits. It also calls for caution in aggregating indicators into composite measures for funding allocation, suggesting multidimensional and profile-sensitive approaches instead. The authors argue that more theoretical and empirical research is needed to design valid, fair, and less distortionary indicators for university–industry KT, and that the lessons from the UK HE-BCI case are relevant internationally, as many countries are considering adopting similar frameworks ￼.

Here’s a ~500-word plain-text summary of Zhou & Baines (2024), To what extent do universities’ formal and informal knowledge exchange activities interact: evidence from UK HE-BCI survey ￼.


This paper examines the interaction between formal and informal knowledge exchange (KE) activities within higher education institutions (HEIs), addressing an important gap in the literature on universities’ “Third Mission” (TM). Traditionally, formal activities such as patents, licensing, and spin-offs have attracted the most attention from scholars and policymakers, while informal activities—such as consultancy, collaborative and contract research, continuing professional development (CPD), and provision of facilities and equipment (FE)—have often been underexplored. The authors argue that informal KE activities are not merely peripheral but may act as enablers or precursors to commercialization outcomes, and they provide empirical evidence using UK-wide HE-BCI survey data from 2005 to 2020.

The paper situates itself in the broader debate on entrepreneurial universities and the Triple Helix model, where HEIs are expected to contribute directly to economic development. It highlights that while commercialization remains a crucial channel, universities engage in a diverse portfolio of activities whose interactions remain poorly understood. Existing studies often analyze individual activities separately, failing to capture how informal KE might contribute to formal commercialization at an institutional level.

Methodologically, the authors use an unbalanced panel of 1,599 HEI-year observations drawn from the HE-BCI survey. Dependent variables are three formal KE outcomes: patent grants, licenses concluded, and spin-offs created. Independent variables measure income from consultancy, CPD, FE, contract research, and collaborative research, lagged by three years to reduce endogeneity. Control variables include patent stock, research income, academic staff numbers, regional gross value-added, KE funding, and Knowledge Exchange Framework (KEF) cluster groupings. The econometric approach employs Poisson regression, quasi-generalized pseudo-maximum likelihood estimation, and negative binomial models (NB1 and NB2), with NB1 chosen as the best fit to address overdispersion.

Findings reveal distinct patterns. For patenting, consultancy, CPD, and FE are all positively associated, with CPD showing the strongest effect. This suggests that low research-intensive engagement activities can support patenting by building expertise and signaling credibility. For licensing, consultancy, CPD, and FE are again positively linked, while contract research shows a surprising negative relationship, possibly because such projects focus on specific deliverables that restrict IP opportunities. For spin-offs, collaborative research is the only informal activity with a significant positive effect, albeit modest, indicating that joint research with external partners provides fertile ground for entrepreneurial ventures. These results are robust across models and emphasize the nuanced roles of different informal activities.

The analysis also highlights heterogeneity across types of universities. Larger, research-intensive institutions and specialist STEM or arts universities demonstrate different KE profiles, with some clusters positively or negatively associated with commercialization outcomes. Moreover, resource-related variables such as patent stock, research funding, and staff capacity consistently predict better commercialization, underscoring the importance of institutional capability. Interestingly, KE funding shows a weak or even negative effect in some models, raising questions about whether current funding allocations effectively support commercialization.

The paper contributes theoretically by advancing the understanding of how informal and formal KE activities interact at the institutional level, rather than focusing only on individual academics. Practically, it offers implications for universities and policymakers. Recognizing that informal KE plays a foundational role in enabling commercialization suggests that support strategies should not be overly focused on patents and spin-offs alone. Instead, policies should encourage a balanced and complementary portfolio of KE activities, tailored to institutional strengths and contexts.

In conclusion, the study demonstrates that informal KE activities matter significantly for commercialization outcomes but in different ways: consultancy, CPD, and FE enhance patenting and licensing, while collaborative research supports spin-off creation. This nuanced evidence underscores the need for multidimensional performance indicators and balanced policy frameworks to strengthen universities’ Third Mission engagement ￼.

Here’s a ~500-word plain-text summary of The Impact of Enterprise and Entrepreneurship Education on Regional Development (Bozward et al., 2021)  ￼.


This paper investigates the role of enterprise and entrepreneurship education (EEE) delivered by higher education institutions (HEIs) in fostering regional development across the UK. The authors situate their work in the policy context of devolution, Brexit, and the COVID-19 pandemic, which have heightened the emphasis on regional disparities and the government’s “levelling up” agenda. They note that entrepreneurship has long been seen as an engine of innovation, growth, and employment, but that the empirical link between university-led entrepreneurship education and measurable regional development remains underexplored in the literature.

To address this, the study combines Higher Education Business and Community Interaction (HE-BCI) survey data from 2014 to 2018 with economic and demographic statistics from the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS). The dataset is structured around 12 UK regions (the four nations plus nine English regions) and includes indicators such as the number of graduate start-ups, their three-year survival rates, employment creation, turnover, and levels of external investment. These are analyzed alongside regional GDP, business birth and death rates, active business counts, student populations, and general population size. By normalizing indicators per capita and per student, the authors develop a comparative picture of how HEIs contribute to regional economies.

Findings reveal significant regional disparities. For business start-ups, London’s HEIs generate the highest absolute number of graduate ventures, but when normalized against population or student numbers, regions such as Wales, the East Midlands, and the North East perform relatively better. Notably, Welsh HEIs account for a higher share of regional business births than London institutions, suggesting greater proportional impact. Business survival analysis shows that in Wales and the North East, graduate start-ups are more likely to remain active after three years, whereas London and Scotland see lower survival rates, raising questions about the long-term sustainability of entrepreneurial ecosystems in wealthier regions. Employment creation shows sharp variation: Northern Ireland graduates create the highest number of jobs per business, followed by Scotland and the South East, while the East of England lags. Turnover data highlight that graduate start-ups contribute meaningfully to GDP in lower-income regions, with Northern Ireland and Scotland showing particularly high proportions relative to regional GDP. This implies that EEE interventions may have the greatest relative impact in economically disadvantaged regions. Investment patterns also reveal disparities: while London and the South East attract the largest absolute sums, return on investment—measured as turnover or employment generated per pound invested—is often stronger in lower GDP regions such as Wales.

The paper argues that no single region demonstrates best practice across all indicators, suggesting that regional ecosystems, institutional quality, and policy environments all condition the outcomes of entrepreneurship education. The analysis emphasizes that raw student numbers or the number of HEIs do not directly predict start-up generation; instead, the quality and nature of entrepreneurship support matter more. Moreover, the relationship between graduate start-up activity and broader regional business dynamics appears reciprocal: regional economic conditions shape HEI start-up outcomes, but HEIs also influence regional entrepreneurship patterns.

The authors conclude that EEE has a tangible but uneven impact on regional development, especially in areas with lower GDP, where universities play a disproportionately important role in stimulating start-ups, jobs, and growth. They recommend targeted investment in HEIs located in disadvantaged regions and a national policy framework to align EEE with regional development goals. The Welsh policy context is highlighted as a positive case of measurable impact, suggesting that similar interventions across the UK could help reduce regional disparities. Limitations include reliance on HE-BCI data, which cannot fully capture the causal links between education provision and economic outcomes. The authors call for further research to connect specific EEE interventions to long-term regional performance and to explore institutional practices that explain observed variations  ￼.

Authors: Qiantao Zhang

Abstract: This article examines the progress of university knowledge exchange in the United Kingdom over a decade, linking theory, practice and policy. As indicated by the literature, the performance of university knowledge exchange is influenced by institutional and locational characteristics. Data on 133 UK universities between 2003–2004 and 2012–2013 are used in the empirical analysis, which confirms the important roles of institutional (established vs. new) and locational (competitive vs. uncompetitive) characteristics of universities. Nevertheless, it is found that the current policy approach in the United Kingdom fails to consider the heterogeneity of the higher education sector. This is problematic given that a substantial amount of funding has been committed to boosting university knowledge exchange over the past 20 years. In addition, the results suggest that the knowledge exchange policy should not be implemented alone; rather, it should be developed in conjunction with industrial and innovation policies.

Here’s a ~500-word plain-text summary of Rae, Martin, Antcliff & Hannon (2012), Enterprise and entrepreneurship in English higher education: 2010 and beyond .


This paper reports findings from the third national survey of enterprise and entrepreneurship (E&E) education and support activity in higher education institutions (HEIs) in England, conducted in 2010 by the Institute for Small Business & Entrepreneurship (ISBE) on behalf of the National Council for Graduate Entrepreneurship (NCGE). It builds on earlier surveys in 2006 and 2007, enabling comparison of trends over a four-year period, and provides insights into the development, challenges, and future prospects of E&E within the higher education sector. The survey gathered responses from 116 HEIs, representing a 92% response rate, and covered both curricular and extra-curricular provision, student engagement, institutional strategies, and funding.

The paper situates the survey in a critical policy and economic context. Between 1999 and 2010, UK higher education benefited from sustained public investment in enterprise through programs like Higher Education Innovation Funding (HEIF). However, by the time of the 2010 survey, public expenditure cuts under the Coalition government had created uncertainty around sustainability. The study thus represents a “high-water mark” for publicly funded enterprise activity, raising questions about how institutions might maintain provision in an era of reduced resources.

Key findings show a marked expansion of enterprise provision since 2006. By 2010, 93% of HEIs supported student enterprise and graduate entrepreneurship, with 80% offering credit-bearing awards or modules and 91% providing extra-curricular support. Average student engagement rates in enterprise (SER) rose from 7% in 2006 to 16% nationally in 2010, though variation across institutions and regions remained substantial. While business and management faculties still played a leading role, 60% of provision was now delivered by non-business disciplines, indicating broader curricular integration. Extracurricular activities also proliferated, including workshops, business plan competitions, summer schools, and the establishment of student enterprise societies, supported by the rise of organizations like NACUE.

The survey highlighted improvements in institutional infrastructure, with 63% embedding enterprise in their mission statements and 60% appointing senior leaders with enterprise responsibilities. Support for staff development and the presence of incubators, hot-desking, and start-up funds also increased. Venture creation was widespread, with HEIs reporting over 3,200 new student and graduate ventures in 2009–10, although data reliability was questioned. Gender disparities persisted, with male students significantly overrepresented in accredited enterprise courses, raising concerns about diversity and access.

Funding patterns revealed heavy reliance on public sources, especially HEIF, though universities increasingly contributed core funds and sought private sponsorship. The shift to HEIF5, which emphasized income generation over teaching or support activities, was seen as a threat to sustaining non-commercial forms of enterprise education. Regionally, disparities in student engagement rates underscored uneven development across England, with smaller or specialist HEIs often achieving higher levels of engagement relative to size.

The paper draws several conclusions. First, although enterprise education had expanded significantly, student participation levels remained relatively low compared to European averages, pointing to the need for more systematic embedding of enterprise across curricula. Second, the sustainability of provision was uncertain, with a need for HEIs to diversify funding sources and demonstrate value creation from entrepreneurial activity. Third, enterprise education was increasingly linked to graduate employability, with arguments that entrepreneurship should be recognized as a graduate outcome in official surveys. Finally, the study emphasized the importance of institutional leadership, collaboration across HEIs, and partnerships with local economic actors in maximizing the impact of E&E.

The authors argue that the 2010 survey played an important role in shaping subsequent government policy, including recommendations in the 2011 Higher Education White Paper and the Wilson Review of business–university collaboration. They caution, however, that measuring enterprise education risks narrowing innovation, and stress the need for approaches that foster an entrepreneurial culture rather than simply quantifying activity. The study concludes that in the post-2010 funding landscape, English universities face a critical challenge: to sustain and deepen enterprise education as an integral component of the entrepreneurial university, contributing not only to graduate employability but also to wider economic and social renewal .
